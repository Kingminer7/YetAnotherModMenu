# YetAnotherQOLMod
A *reinterpretation* of the ***_<c-FF0000>unique</c>_*** features from [QOLMod by TheSillyDoggo](https://web.archive.org/web/20250114142643/https://github.com/TheSillyDoggo/GeodeMenu), which has been [discontinued](https://web.archive.org/web/20250127100100im_/https://preview.redd.it/another-day-another-stupid-drama-with-the-qolmod-dev-v0-yu5ye34yhvee1.jpeg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=14055703c9f0798bf855fdddefaa885297c60ab6). Use **Shift + Tab** to open its settings!

Features re-created and expanded upon from QOLMod:
- Change your trail blending and trail length [based on `Longer Trail` and `No Trail Blending`]
- Change the thickness of your wave trail [based on `No Wave Pulse`] <c-00FFFF>(requested by CatXus)</c>
- Show your highest percentage in the percentage label (and choose a separator) [based on `Best In Percentage`]
- Pulse a node of your choice from MenuLayer to the menu loop [based on `Pulse Menu`]
- Access the Icon Kit/Garage from the pause menu [based on `Icon Kit in Pause`] (with help from [km7](https://github.com/Kingminer7))
- Trace a direct path to the secret/user coins of a level, and color it based on its status [based on `Coin Finder`]

<cy>Feature requests for this mod</c> ***<c-ff0000>will NOT</c>*** <cy>be accepted.</c>

Any other presumably "unique" QOLMod features:
- will benefit in becoming (or already exists as) a standalone mod
- already exists in another mod menu

<c-888888>*For a mod that uses GD 2.1's percentage calculation, see [Percentage Toggle by ZSA](mod:zsa.percentage-toggle).*</c>

## Disclaimer

When Geode v5 releases (so a *very* distant time from now), many of this mod's features ***_<c-FF0000>may</c>_*** be removed from this mod and merged into [Eclipse Menu](mod:eclipse.eclipse-menu). When this process is complete, this mod will exclusively become a <c-FFD700>coinfinder mod</c>.
